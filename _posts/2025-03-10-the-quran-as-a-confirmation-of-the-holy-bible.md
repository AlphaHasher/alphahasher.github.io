### Jesus (from the Quran) Confirms the Bible

> Surah 3:48\-50  
> And Allah will teach him writing and wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel,
> 
> 
> 
> 
> and ˹make him˺ a messenger to the Children of Israel ˹to proclaim,˺ ‘I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I will make for you a bird from clay, breathe into it, and it will become a ˹real˺ bird—by Allah’s Will. I will heal the blind and the leper and raise the dead to life—by Allah’s Will. And I will prophesize what you eat and store in your houses. Surely in this is a sign for you if you ˹truly˺ believe.
> 
> 
> 
> 
> And I will confirm the Torah revealed before me and legalize some of what had been forbidden to you. I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so be mindful of Allah and obey me.




The Bible Could not have been corrupted because we have copies of the Torah written before and after Jesus, and during the time in which Muhammad lives and it is the same one we have today.

Muhammad, when he himself doubted, was told by Allah that he can rely on the “Scriptures.”





> Surah 10:94  
> If you ˹O Prophet˺ are in doubt about ˹these stories˺ that We have revealed to you, then ask those who read the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt,

### The Scriptures Can't Be Corrupt





> Surah 6:115  
> The Word of your Lord has been perfected in truth and justice. **None can change His Words**. And He is the All\-Hearing, All\- Knowing.








> Surah 18:27  
> Recite what has been revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. **None can change His Words**, nor can you find any refuge besides Him.








> Qur'an 5:43\-48 (Shakir)
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 44. But why do they come to you for judgment when they ˹already˺ have the Torah containing Allah’s judgment, then they turn away after all? They are not ˹true˺ believers.
> 
> 48. Indeed, We revealed the Torah, containing guidance and light, by which the prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah, made judgments for Jews. So too did the rabbis and scholars judge according to Allah’s Book, with which they were entrusted and of which they were made keepers. So do not fear the people; fear Me! Nor trade my revelations for a fleeting gain. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the disbelievers.
> 
> 52. We ordained for them in the Torah, “A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth—and for wounds equal retaliation.” But whoever waives it charitably, it will be atonement for them. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the wrongdoers.
> 
> 56. Then in the footsteps of the prophets, We sent Jesus, son of Mary, **confirming the Torah revealed before him. And We gave him the Gospel** containing guidance and light and confirming what was revealed in the Torah—a guide and a lesson to the God\-fearing.
> 
> 60. **So let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed in it**. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the rebellious.
> 
> 64. We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ this Book with the truth, as a confirmation of previous Scriptures and a supreme authority on them. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires over the truth that has come to you. To each of you We have ordained a code of law and a way of life. If Allah had willed, He would have made you one community, but His Will is to test you with what He has given ˹each of˺ you. So compete with one another in doing good. To Allah you will all return, then He will inform you ˹of the truth˺ regarding your differences.





> Qur'an 5:68
> 
> 
> 
> 
> Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O People of the Book! You have nothing to stand on unless you observe the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord.” And your Lord’s revelation to you ˹O Prophet˺ will only cause many of them to increase in wickedness and disbelief. So do not grieve for the people who disbelieve.




#### Allah Gave the Psalms to David





> Surah 4:163  
> Indeed, We have sent revelation to you ˹O Prophet˺ as We sent revelation to Noah and the prophets after him. We also sent revelation to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants, ˹as well as˺ Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon. **And to David We gave the Psalms.**








> Surah 17:55  
> Your Lord knows best all those in the heavens and the earth. And We have surely favoured some prophets above others, and to David We gave the Psalms.






---





> Surah 21:105  
> Surely, following the ˹heavenly˺ Record, We decreed in the Scriptures: “My righteous servants shall inherit the land.”1




A direct quotation from:





> Psalm 37:29 \- LSB  
> 29 The righteous will inherit the land  
> And dwell in it forever.




So the Scriptures are authoritative in the Qur’an

The foregoing passages are quite clear and very explicit regarding the Quran's position on the previous Scriptures. The author of the Quran believed that the Revelation which the Jews and Christians of his time had in their very own possessions, which would have been the Holy Bible, was God's true and preserved Word, and that the function of the Quran was to confirm them. But as anyone reading the Holy Bible and the Quran readily sees, the Quran does anything but confirm the previous Scriptures. This leads to the inevitable conclusion that the Quran is not God's Word. The Quran fails to do what it claims it was sent out to do, namely confirm the previous Scriptures. The Quran thereby falsifies itself since it testifies that the Holy Bible is God's Word while contradicting its core, essential doctrines at the same time.
