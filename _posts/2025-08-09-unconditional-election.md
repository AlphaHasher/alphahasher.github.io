## Sovereign Election

It would have been perfectly just for God to have left all men in their sin and misery and to have shown mercy to none. God was under no obligation whatsoever to provide salvation for anyone. It is in this context that the Bible sets forth the doctrine of election.

The doctrine of election declares that God, before the foundation of the world, chose certain individuals from among the fallen members of Adam's race to be the objects of his undeserved favor. These, and these only, he purposed to save. God could have chosen to save all men (for he had the power and authority to do so) or he could have chosen to save none (for he was under no obligation to show mercy to any) - but he did neither. Instead, he chose to save some and exclude others. His eternal choice of particular sinners for salvation was not based upon any foreseen act or response on the part of those selected, but was based solely on his own good pleasure and sovereign will. Thus, election was not determined by, or conditioned upon, anything that men would do, but resulted entirely from God's self-determined purpose.

Those who were not chosen for salvation were passed by and left to their own evil devices and choices. It is not within the creature's jurisdiction to call into question the justice of the creator for not choosing everyone for salvation. It is enough to know that the judge of the earth has done right. It should, however, be kept in mind that if God had not graciously chosen a people for himself and sovereignly determined to provide salvation for them and apply it to them, none would be saved. The fact that he did this for some, to the exclusion of others, is in no way unfair to the latter group, unless of course one maintains that God was under obligation to provide salvation for sinners - a position which the Bible utterly rejects.

The act of election itself saved no one; what it did was to mark out certain individuals for salvation. Consequently, the doctrine of election must not be divorced from the doctrines of human guilt, redemption, and regeneration, or else it will be distorted and misrepresented. In other words, if the Father's act of election is to be kept in its proper biblical balance and correctly understood, it must be related to the redeeming work of the Son, who gave himself to save the elect, and to the renewing work of the Spirit, who brings the elect to faith in Christ.

>
> <sup> 14 </sup>These will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are with Him <i>are the </i>called and elect and faithful.”
 
### B. Before the foundation of the world, God chose particular individuals unto salvation. His selection was not based upon any foreseen response or act performed by those chosen. Faith and good works are the result, not the cause of God’s choice.

#### 1. God did the choosing

> Mark 13:20 - LSB
>
> <sup> 20 </sup>And unless the Lord had shortened <i>those </i>days, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom He chose, He shortened the days.
 

^ See also 1 Thessalonians 1:4 and 2 Thessalonians 2:13 quoted below. ^

#### 2. God’s choice was made before the foundation of the world.

> Ephesians 1:4 - LSB
>
> <sup> 4 </sup>just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him in love,
 

^ See 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 1:9; Revelation 13:8 and Revelation 17:8 quoted below. ^

#### 3. God chose particular individuals unto salvation—their names were written in the book of life before the foundation of the world.

> Revelation 13:8 - LSB
>
> <sup> 8 </sup>And all who dwell on the earth will worship him, <i>everyone </i>whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been slain.
 

> Revelation 17:8 - LSB
>
> <sup> 8 </sup>“The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth, whose name has not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will wonder when they see the beast, that he was and is not and will come.
 

#### 4. God’s choice was not based upon any foreseen merit residing in those whom He chose, nor was it based on any foreseen good works performed by them.

> Romans 9:11-13 - LSB
>
> <sup> 11 </sup>for though <i>the twins </i>were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that the purpose of God according to <i>His </i>choice would stand, not because of works but because of Him who calls,
> <sup> 12 </sup>it was said to her, “The older shall serve the younger.”
> <sup> 13 </sup>Just as it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”
 

> Romans 9:16 - LSB
>
> <sup> 16 </sup>So then it <i>does </i>not <i>depend </i>on the one who wills or the one who runs, but on God who has mercy.
 

R.C Sproul noted that Romans 9:16 should be “the verse to end [[Arminianism]], once and for all”

> Romans 10:20 - LSB
>
> <sup> 20 </sup>And Isaiah is very bold and says,“I was found by those who did not seek Me,<br/>I became manifest to those who did not ask for Me.”
 

> 1 Corinthians 1:27-29 - LSB
>
> <sup> 27 </sup>But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong,
> <sup> 28 </sup>and the base things of the world and the despised God has chosen, the things that are not, so that He may abolish the things that are,
> <sup> 29 </sup>so that no flesh may boast before God.
 

> 2 Timothy 1:9 - LSB
>
> <sup> 9 </sup>who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus from all eternity,
 
#### 5. Good works are the result, not the ground, of predestination.


> Ephesians 1:12 - RSV
>
> 12 - We who first hoped in Christ have been *destined and appointed* to live for the praise of his glory.
>  

> Ephesians 2:10 - LSB
>
> <sup> 10 </sup>For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.
 

> John 15:16 - LSB
>
> <sup> 16 </sup>You did not choose Me but I chose you, and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit, and <i>that </i>your fruit would abide, so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you.
 

#### 6. God’s choice was not based upon foreseen faith. Faith is the result and therefore the evidence of God’s election, not the cause or ground of His choice.

> Acts 13:48 - LSB
>
> <sup> 48 </sup>And when the Gentiles heard this, they <i>began </i>rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed.
 

> Acts 18:27 - LSB
>
> <sup> 27 </sup>…he greatly helped those who had believed through grace
 

> Philippians 1:29 - LSB
>
> <sup> 29 </sup>For to you it has been granted for Christ’s sake, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake,
 

> 1 Thessalonians 1:4-5 - LSB
>
> <sup> 4 </sup>knowing, brothers beloved by God, your election,
> <sup> 5 </sup>for our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full assurance; just as you know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake.
 

> 2 Thessalonians 2:13-14 - LSB
>
> <sup> 13 </sup>But we should always give thanks to God for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, **because God has chosen you** as the first fruits for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth.
> <sup> 14 </sup>It was for this He called you through our gospel, that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
 

> James 2:5 - LSB
>
> <sup> 5 </sup>Listen, my beloved brothers: **did not God choose** the poor of this world <i>to be </i>rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?
 

#### 7. It is by faith and good works that one confirms his calling and election.

> 2 Peter 1:5-11 - LSB
>
> <sup> 5 </sup>Now for this very reason also, applying all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence, and in <i>your </i>moral excellence, knowledge,
> <sup> 6 </sup>and in <i>your </i>knowledge, self-control, and in <i>your </i>self-control, perseverance, and in <i>your </i>perseverance, godliness,
> <sup> 7 </sup>and in <i>your </i>godliness, brotherly kindness, and in <i>your </i>brotherly kindness, love.
> <sup> 8 </sup>For if these things are yours and are increasing, they render you neither useless nor unfruitful in the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
> <sup> 9 </sup>For in whom these things are not present, <i>that one </i>is blind, being nearsighted, having forgotten the purification from his former sins.
> <sup> 10 </sup>Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent **to make your calling and choosing (ESV has is “election”) sure**; for in doing these things, you will never stumble;
> <sup> 11 </sup>for in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be abundantly supplied to you.
 
### C. Election is not salvation but is unto salvation. Just as the president-elect does not become the president of the United States until he is inaugurated, those chosen unto salvation are not saved until they are regenerated by the Spirit and justified by faith in Christ. 

> Romans 11:7 - LSB
>
> <sup> 7 </sup>What then? What Israel is seeking, it has not obtained, but the **chosen obtained it**, and the rest were hardened;
 

> 2 Timothy 2:10 - LSB
>
> <sup> 10 </sup>For this reason I endure all things for the sake of the elect, so that they also may obtain the salvation, which is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
 

^ See Acts 13:48; 1 Thessalonians 1:4 and 2 Thessalonians 2:13, 14 quoted above. Compare Ephesians 1:4 with Romans 16:7.

In Ephesians 1:4 Paul shows that men were chosen “in Christ” before the world began. From Romans 16:7 it is clear that men are not actually “in Christ” until their conversion ^

### D. Election was based on the sovereign, distinguishing mercy of Almighty God. It was not man’s will but God’s will that determined which sinners would be shown mercy and saved. 

> Exodus 33:19 - LSB
>
> <sup> 19 </sup>And He said, “I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of Yahweh before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will show compassion on whom I will show compassion.”
 

> Deuteronomy 7:6-7 - LSB
>
> <sup> 6 </sup>For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God; Yahweh your God has chosen you to be a people for His own treasured possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.
> <sup> 7 </sup>“Yahweh did not set His affection on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any of the peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples,
 

> Matthew 20:15 - LSB
>
> <sup> 15 </sup>Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is my own? Or is your eye envious because I am generous?’
 

> Romans 9:10-24 - LSB
>
> <sup> 10 </sup>And not only this, but there was Rebekah also, when she had conceived <i>twins </i>by one man, our father Isaac;
> <sup> 11 </sup>for though <i>the twins </i>were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that the purpose of God according to <i>His </i>choice would stand, not because of works but because of Him who calls,
> <sup> 12 </sup>it was said to her, “The older shall serve the younger.”
> <sup> 13 </sup>Just as it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”
> <sup> 14 </sup>What shall we say then? Is there any unrighteousness with God? May it never be!
> <sup> 15 </sup>For He says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”
> <sup> 16 </sup>So then it <i>does </i>not <i>depend </i>on the one who wills or the one who runs, but on God who has mercy.
> <sup> 17 </sup>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I raised you up, in order to demonstrate My power in you, and in order that My name might be proclaimed throughout the whole earth.”
> <sup> 18 </sup>So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires.
> <sup> 19 </sup>You will say to me then, “Why does He still find fault? For who resists His will?”
> <sup> 20 </sup>On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers back to God? Will the thing molded say to the molder, “Why did you make me like this”?
> <sup> 21 </sup>Or does not the potter have authority over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use?
> <sup> 22 </sup>And what if God, wanting to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath having been prepared for destruction,
> <sup> 23 </sup>and in order that He might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory—
> <sup> 24 </sup><i>even </i>us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles?
 

> Romans 11:4-6 - LSB
>
> <sup> 4 </sup>But what does the divine response say to him? “I have left for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”
> <sup> 5 </sup>In this way then, at the present time, a remnant according to **<i>God’s </i>gracious choice has also come to be.**
> <sup> 6 </sup>But if it is by grace, it is no longer of works, otherwise grace is no longer grace.
 
 
^ Compare 1 Kings 19:10, 18. ^

> Romans 11:33-36 - LSB
>
> <sup> 33 </sup>Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!
> <sup> 34 </sup>For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who became His counselor?
> <sup> 35 </sup>Or who has first given to Him that it might be repaid to him?
> <sup> 36 </sup>For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him <i>be </i>the glory forever. Amen.
 

> Ephesians 1:5 - LSB
>
> <sup> 5 </sup>by **predestining us** to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will,
 

### E. The doctrine of election is but a part of the much broader Biblical doctrine of God’s absolute sovereignty. The Scriptures not only teach that God predestined certain individuals unto eternal life, but that all events, both small and great, come about as the result of God’s eternal decree. The Lord God rules over heaven and earth with absolute control; nothing comes to pass apart from His eternal purpose.

> 1 Chronicles 29:10-12 - LSB
>
> <sup> 10 </sup>So David blessed Yahweh in the sight of all the assembly; and David said, “Blessed are You, O Yahweh, the God of Israel our father, from everlasting to everlasting.
> <sup> 11 </sup>Yours, O Yahweh, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, indeed everything that is in the heavens and the earth; Yours is the kingdom, O Yahweh, and You exalt Yourself as head over all.
> <sup> 12 </sup>Both riches and honor <i>come </i>from You, and You rule over all, and in Your hand is power and might; and it lies in Your hand to make great and to strengthen everyone.

>
> <sup> 24 </sup>Yahweh of hosts has sworn saying, “Surely, just as I have intended so it has happened, and just as I have counseled so it will stand,
> <sup> 27 </sup>For Yahweh of hosts has counseled, and who can thwart <i>it</i>? And as for His stretched-out hand, who can turn it back?”
 

> Isaiah 46:9-11 - LSB
>
> <sup> 9 </sup>Remember the former things long past,<br/>For I am God, and there is no other;<br/><i>I am </i>God, and there is no one like Me,<br/>
> <sup> 10 </sup>Declaring the end from the beginning,<br/>And from ancient times things which have not been done,<br/>Saying, ‘My counsel will be established,<br/>And I will accomplish all My good pleasure’,<br/>
> <sup> 11 </sup>Calling a bird of prey from the east,<br/>The man of My counsel from a far country.<br/>Truly I have spoken; truly I will bring it to pass.<br/>I have formed <i>it</i>, surely I will do it.
 

> Isaiah 55:11 - LSB
>
> <sup> 11 </sup>So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth;<br/>It will not return to Me empty,<br/>Without accomplishing what pleases Me,<br/>And without succeeding <i>in the matter </i>for which I sent it.
 

> Jeremiah 32:17 - LSB
>
> <sup> 17 </sup>‘Ah Lord Yahweh! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm! Nothing is too difficult for You,
 

> Daniel 4:35 - LSB
>
> <sup> 35 </sup>And all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing,<br/>But He does according to His will in the host of heaven<br/>And <i>among </i>the inhabitants of earth;<br/>And no one can strike against His hand<br/>Or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’
 

> Matthew 19:25-26 - LSB
>
> <sup> 25 </sup>And when the disciples heard <i>this</i>, they were very astonished and said, “Then who can be saved?” **(In regards to Salvation)**
> <sup> 26 </sup>And looking at <i>them </i>Jesus said to them, “With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”

>
> <sup> 10 </sup>And not only this, but there was Rebekah also, when she had conceived <i>twins </i>by one man, our father Isaac;
> <sup> 11 </sup>for though <i>the twins </i>were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that the purpose of God according to <i>His </i>choice would stand, not because of works but because of Him who calls,
> <sup> 12 </sup>it was said to her, “The older shall serve the younger.”
> <sup> 13 </sup>Just as it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”
> <sup> 14 </sup>What shall we say then? Is there any unrighteousness with God? May it never be!
> <sup> 15 </sup>For He says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”
> <sup> 16 </sup>So then it <i>does </i>not <i>depend </i>on the one who wills or the one who runs, but on God who has mercy.
> <sup> 17 </sup>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I raised you up, in order to demonstrate My power in you, and in order that My name might be proclaimed throughout the whole earth.”
> <sup> 18 </sup>So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires.
> <sup> 19 </sup>You will say to me then, “Why does He still find fault? For who resists His will?”
> <sup> 20 </sup>On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers back to God? Will the thing molded say to the molder, “Why did you make me like this”?
> <sup> 21 </sup>Or does not the potter have authority over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use?
