The first time the gospel was promised in the Old Testament was in the context of a curse. As a result of the fall, God cursed Adam and Eve as well as the serpent. God said that the Seed of the woman would crush the serpent’s head, and in the process the seed of the serpent would bruise the man’s heel. Centuries before Christ was delivered to the cross, where He crushed the head of Satan while being bruised for our iniquities, the gospel of Christ was given in the promise of the curse of the enemy. That is the *protoeuangelion*, the first proclamation of the gospel





> Genesis 3:14-19  
> 14 And Yahweh God said to the serpent,“Because you have done this,  
> Cursed are you more than any of the cattle,  
> And more than every beast of the field;  
> On your belly you will go,  
> And dust you will eat  
> All the days of your life;  
>   
> 15 And I will put enmity  
> Between you and the woman,  
> And between your seed and her seed;  
> He shall bruise you on the head,  
> And you shall bruise him on the heel.”  
>   
> 16 To the woman He said,“I will greatly multiply  
> Your pain and conception,  
> In pain you will bear children;  
> Your desire will be for your husband,  
> And he will rule over you.”  
>   
> 17 Then to Adam He said, “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat from it’;Cursed is the ground because of you;  
> In pain you will eat of it  
> All the days of your life.  
>   
> 18 Both thorns and thistles it shall grow for you;  
> And you will eat the plants of the field;  
>   
> 19 By the sweat of your face  
> You will eat bread,  
> Till you return to the ground,  
> Because from it you were taken;  
> For you are dust,  
> And to dust you shall return.”
