Pastors and teachers should never rest complacently in what they already know through past study and training. They must labor to grow theologically. Timothy had traveled with and learned from one of the greatest theologians of all time (2 Tim. 2:2; 3:10), but Paul still exhorted him, “Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all. Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee” (1 Tim. 4:15–16).

> <sup> 2 </sup>And the things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.


> 2 Timothy 3:10 - LSB

> <sup> 10 </sup>But you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, perseverance,


> 1 Timothy 4:15-16 - LSB
>
> <sup> 15 </sup>Take pains with these things; be <i>absorbed </i>in them, so that your progress will be evident to all.
> <sup> 16 </sup>Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching; persevere in these things, for as you do this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.
