## Summary

The “whole world” means nations outside of Israel.

## Exegesis

This verse is not troublesome once we understand John is not explaining the intent of the atonement but is only repeating some basic Christian truths. Remember that in the early church, many Jews found it hard to believe that God would save the Gentiles. This verse addresses this problem, reminding us that the one who saves the Jews is the same one who saves the Gentiles. Jesus is the propitiation for both Jew and Gentile. The passage says nothing in favor of Him dying for every individual on earth.

So 1 John 2:2 merely tells us there is only one way of salvation. If anyone will be redeemed, he will be redeemed through Jesus, the only Savior (John 14:6). First Timothy 2:4 can be approached similarly. Verses 1–3 tell us the “all” in this passage means all kinds of people, not every individual. God desires some from every socio-economic class, ethnicity, and so on to be saved. He does not intend for Jesus to pay for the sins of everyone who has ever lived.
