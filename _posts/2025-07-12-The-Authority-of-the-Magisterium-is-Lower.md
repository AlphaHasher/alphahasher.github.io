Below are Roman Catholic sources saying that while the Magisterium is held to be guided by the Holy Spirit, its teachings are not considered to be divinely inspired in the same way as Scripture.

# Dei Verbum: The Servant of the Word of God
- Promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1965 during the 2nd Vatican Council

In article 10, the document explicitly outlines the relationship between Sacred Tradition, Sacred Scripture, and the Magisterium, stating that the Magisterium is not superior to the Word of God, but its servant:

> They are bound by the Word of God. For “the Magisterium is not above the Word of God but serves it, teaching only what has been handed down, as ... it listens to this, guards it scrupulously, and expounds it faithfully; and it draws from this one deposit of faith all that it proposes as being divinely revealed.”
