> And I gave my heart to seek and explore by wisdom concerning all that has been done under heaven. *It* is a grievous endeavor *which* God has given to the sons of men with which to occupy *themselves*. I have seen all the works which have been done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and striving after wind. What is bent cannot be straightened, and what is lacking cannot be counted.

So why write? If what the author of Ecclesiastes wrote is true then all is vanity — a striving after wind. 




I am not going to bore you with some philosophical quandary leaving you with more questions, so let me tell you why I write.




I write because I love truth. It was Jesus who said “If you abide in My word, *then* you are truly My disciples; and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.” (John 8:31b\-32\).




In this blog I desire to seek this truth and express it in writing, and I pray that what I write would give just a little more clarity in your life. To live *[Coram Deo](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/devotionals/living-coram-deo)*, “in the presence of God”.




The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
