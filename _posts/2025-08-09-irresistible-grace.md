## Effectual Grace

Although the general outward call of the gospel can be, and often is, rejected, the special inward call of the Spirit never fails to result in the conversion of those to whom it is made. This special call is not made to all sinners but is issued to the elect only. The Spirit is in no way dependent upon their help or cooperation for success in his work of bringing them to Christ. It is for this reason that Calvinists speak of the Spirit's call and of God's grace in saving sinners as being “efficacious,” “invincible,” or “irresistible.” The grace which the Holy Spirit extends to the elect cannot be thwarted or refused; it never fails to bring them to true faith in Christ.

Nevertheless, the canons do not regard men as if they were soulless machines without a will: “The grace of regeneration does not treat men as senseless stocks and blocks, nor takes away their will and its properties, neither does violence thereto; but spiritually quickens, heals, corrects, and at the same time sweetly and powerfully bends it” toward sincere obedience.[^1] God works through the means of the gospel, addressing men’s minds through the preaching of the Word, which must not be neglected.[^2] Many Puritans wrote on the subject of effectual calling and conversion; one excellent resource is by John Flavel (c. 1628–1691), The Method of Grace in the Gospel Redemption.[^3]

## Biblical Support
### A. General statements showing that salvation is the work of the Spirit as well as that of the Father and the Son.

> Romans 8:14 - LSB
>
> <sup> 14 </sup>For as many as are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.
 

> 1 Corinthians 2:10-14 - LSB
>
> <sup> 10 </sup>But to us God revealed <i>them </i>through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.
> <sup> 11 </sup>For who among men knows the <i>depths </i>of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the <i>depths </i>of God no one knows except the Spirit of God.
> <sup> 12 </sup>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the <i>depths </i>graciously given to us by God,
> <sup> 13 </sup>of which <i>depths </i>we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual <i>depths </i>with spiritual <i>words</i>.
> <sup> 14 </sup>But a natural man does not accept the <i>depths </i>of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually examined.
 

> 1 Corinthians 6:11 - LSB
>
> <sup> 11 </sup>And such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.
 

> 1 Corinthians 12:3 - LSB
>
> <sup> 3 </sup>Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is accursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.
 

> 2 Corinthians 3:6 - LSB
>
> <sup> 6 </sup>who also made us sufficient <i>as </i>ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
 

> 2 Corinthians 3:17-18 - LSB
>
> <sup> 17 </sup>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, <i>there </i>is freedom.
> <sup> 18 </sup>But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit.
 

> 1 Peter 1:2 - LSB
>
> <sup> 2 </sup>according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to the obedience of Jesus Christ and the sprinkling of His blood: May grace and peace be multiplied to you.
 

### B. Through regeneration or the new birth sinners are given spiritual life and made God’s children. The Bible describes this process as a spiritual resurrection, a creation, the giving of a new heart, etc. The inward change, which is thus wrought through the Holy Spirit, results from God’s power and grace, and in no way is He dependent upon man’s help for success in this work.

#### 1. Sinners, through regeneration, are brought into God’s kingdom and are made His children. The author of this “second” birth is the Holy Spirit; the instrument which He uses is the word of God.

> John 1:12-13 - LSB
>
> <sup> 12 </sup>But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, <i>even </i>to those who believe in His name,
> <sup> 13 </sup>who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.
 

> John 3:3-8 - LSB
>
> <sup> 3 </sup>Jesus answered and said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.”
> <sup> 4 </sup>Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?”
> <sup> 5 </sup>Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
> <sup> 6 </sup>That which has been born of the flesh is flesh, and that which has been born of the Spirit is spirit.
> <sup> 7 </sup>Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’
> <sup> 8 </sup>The wind blows where it wishes and you hear its sound, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who has been born of the Spirit.”
 

> Titus 3:5 - LSB
>
> <sup> 5 </sup>He saved us, not by works which we did in righteousness, but according to His mercy, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,
 

> 1 Peter 1:3 - LSB
>
> <sup> 3 </sup>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
 

> 1 Peter 1:23 - LSB
>
> <sup> 23 </sup>for you have been born again not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, <i>that is</i>, through the living and enduring word of God.
 

> 1 John 5:4 - LSB
>
> <sup> 4 </sup>For everything that has been born of God overcomes the world; and this is the overcoming that has overcome the world—our faith.
 

#### 2. Through the Spirit’s work the dead sinner is given a new heart (nature) and made to walk in God’s law. In Christ he becomes a new creation.

> Deuteronomy 30:6 - LSB
>
> <sup> 6 </sup>“Moreover Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your seed, to love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul, so that you may live.
 

> Ezekiel 36:26-27 - LSB
>
> <sup> 26 </sup>Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.
> <sup> 27 </sup>I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will be careful to do My judgments.
 

> Galatians 6:15 - LSB
>
> <sup> 15 </sup>For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
 

> Ephesians 2:10 - LSB
>
> <sup> 10 </sup>For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.
 

> 2 Corinthians 5:17-18 - LSB
>
> <sup> 17 </sup>Therefore if anyone is in Christ, <i>he is </i>a new creation; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.
> <sup> 18 </sup>Now all <i>these </i>things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation,
 

#### 3. The Holy Spirit raises the sinner from his state of spiritual death and makes him alive.

> John 5:21 - LSB
>
> <sup> 21 </sup>For just as the Father raises the dead and gives <i>them </i>life, even so the Son also gives life **to whom He wishes**.
 

> Ephesians 2:1-5 - RSV
> 1 - And you he *made alive*, when you were dead through the trespasses and sins
> 5 - even when we were dead in our trespasses, (God) made us *alive* together with Christ…

> Colossians 2:13 - LSB
>
> <sup> 13 </sup>And you being dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, **He made you alive with Him**, having graciously forgiven us all our transgressions.
 

### C. God makes known to His chosen ones the secrets of the kingdom through the inward personal revelation given by the Spirit.


> Matthew 11:25-27 - LSB
>
> <sup> 25 </sup><b>Come to Me</b><br/>At that time Jesus said, “I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from <i>the </i>wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants.
> <sup> 26 </sup>Yes, Father, for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight.
> <sup> 27 </sup>All things have been handed over to Me by My Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal <i>Him</i>.
 

> Luke 10:21 - LSB
>
> <sup> 21 </sup>At that very time He rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit, and said, “I praise You, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from <i>the </i>wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight.
 

> Matthew 13:10, 11-16 - LSB
>
> <sup> 10 </sup><b>The Purpose of the Parables</b><br/>And the disciples came and said to Him, “Why do You speak to them in parables?”
> <sup> 11 </sup>And Jesus answered and said to them, “To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.
> <sup> 16 </sup>But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear.
 

> Luke 8:10 - LSB
>
> <sup> 10 </sup>And He said, “To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest <i>it is </i>in parables, so that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.
 

> Matthew 16:15-17 - LSB
>
> <sup> 15 </sup>He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?”
> <sup> 16 </sup>And Simon Peter answered and said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
> <sup> 17 </sup>And Jesus answered and said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, because flesh and blood did not reveal <i>this </i>to you, but My Father who is in heaven.
 

> John 6:37, 44, 45, 64, 65 - LSB
>
> <sup> 37 </sup>All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will never cast out.
> <sup> 44 </sup>No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day.
> <sup> 45 </sup>It is written in the prophets, ‘And they shall all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me
> <sup> 64 </sup>But there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was that would betray Him.
> <sup> 65 </sup>And He was saying, “For this reason I have said to you, that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted him from the Father.”
 

> 1 Corinthians 2:14 - LSB
>
> <sup> 14 </sup>But a natural man does not accept the <i>depths </i>of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually examined.
 

> Ephesians 1:17-18 - LSB
>
> <sup> 17 </sup>that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you <i>the </i>Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the full knowledge of Him,
> <sup> 18 </sup>so that you—the eyes of your heart having been enlightened—will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,
 

See also John 10:3–6, 16, 26–29.

### D. Faith and repentance are divine gifts and are wrought in the soul through the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit.

> Acts 5:31 - LSB
>
> <sup> 31 </sup>This One God exalted to His right hand as a Leader and a Savior, to grant repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.
 

> Acts 11:18 - LSB
>
> <sup> 18 </sup>And when they heard this, they quieted down and glorified God, saying, “Well then, God has granted to the Gentiles also the repentance <i>that leads </i>to life.”
 

> Acts 13:48 - LSB
>
> <sup> 48 </sup>And when the Gentiles heard this, they <i>began </i>rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed.
 

> Acts 16:14 - LSB
>
> <sup> 14 </sup>And a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple fabrics, a worshiper of God, was listening, whose heart the Lord opened to pay attention to the things spoken by Paul.
 

> Acts 18:27 - LSB
>
> <sup> 27 </sup>And when he wanted to go across to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him; and when he had arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace,
 

> Ephesians 2:8-9 - LSB
>
> <sup> 8 </sup>For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves, <i>it is </i>the gift of God;
> <sup> 9 </sup>not of works, so that no one may boast.
 

> Philippians 1:29 - LSB
>
> <sup> 29 </sup>For to you it has been granted for Christ’s sake, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake,
 

> 2 Timothy 2:25-26 - LSB
>
> <sup> 25 </sup>with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may give them repentance leading to the full knowledge of the truth,
> <sup> 26 </sup>and they may come to their senses <i>and escape </i>from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.
 

### E. The gospel invitation extends a general outward call to salvation to all who hear the message. In addition to this external call, the Holy Spirit extends a special inward call to the elect only. The general call of the gospel can be, and often is, rejected, but the special call of the Spirit cannot be rejected; it always results in the conversion of those to whom it is made.

> Acts 16:14-15 - LSB
>
> <sup> 14 </sup>And a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple fabrics, a worshiper of God, was listening, **whose heart the Lord opened to pay attention to the things spoken by Paul.**
> <sup> 15 </sup>And when she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay.” And she prevailed upon us.
 

> Romans 1:6-7 - LSB
>
> <sup> 6 </sup>among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ;
> <sup> 7 </sup>to all who are beloved of God in Rome, called <i>as </i>saints…
 

> Romans 8:30 - LSB
>
> <sup> 30 </sup>and those whom He predestined, He also called; and those whom He called, He also justified; and those whom He justified, He also glorified.
 

> Romans 9:23-24 - LSB
>
> <sup> 23 </sup>and in order that He might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory—
> <sup> 24 </sup><i>even </i>us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles?
 

> 1 Corinthians 1:1, 2, 9, 23–31 - LSB
>
> <sup> 1 </sup>Paul, called <i>as </i>an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,
> <sup> 2 </sup>To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called as saints, with all who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their <i>Lord </i>and ours:
> <sup> 9 </sup>God is faithful, through whom you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
> <sup> 23 </sup>but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness,
> <sup> 24 </sup>but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
> <sup> 25 </sup>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
> <sup> 26 </sup>For consider your calling, brothers, that there were not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble.
> <sup> 27 </sup>But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong,
> <sup> 28 </sup>and the base things of the world and the despised God has chosen, the things that are not, so that He may abolish the things that are,
> <sup> 29 </sup>so that no flesh may boast before God.
> <sup> 30 </sup>But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,
> <sup> 31 </sup>so that, just as it is written, “Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord.”
 

> Galatians 1:15-16 - LSB
>
> <sup> 15 </sup>But when God, who had set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me through His grace, was pleased
> <sup> 16 </sup>to reveal His Son in me so that I might proclaim Him as good news among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,
 

> Ephesians 4:4 - LSB
>
> <sup> 4 </sup><i>There is </i>one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling;
 

> 2 Timothy 1:9 - LSB
>
> <sup> 9 </sup>who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus from all eternity,
 

> Hebrews 9:15 - LSB
>
> <sup> 15 </sup>And for this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of the trespasses that were <i>committed </i>under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
 

> Jude 1:1 - LSB
>
> <sup> 1 </sup>Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, To those who are the called, beloved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ:
 

> 1 Peter 1:15 - LSB
>
> <sup> 15 </sup>but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all <i>your </i>conduct;
 

> 1 Peter 2:9 - LSB
>
> <sup> 9 </sup>But you are a chosen family, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for <i>God’s </i>own possession, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;
 

> 1 Peter 5:10 - LSB
>
> <sup> 10 </sup>And after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself restore, strengthen, confirm, <i>and </i>ground you.
 

> 2 Peter 1:3 - LSB
>
> <sup> 3 </sup>seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the full knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence.
 

> Revelation 17:14 - LSB
>
> <sup> 14 </sup>These will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are with Him <i>are the </i>called and elect and faithful.”
 

### F. The application of salvation is all of grace and is accomplished solely through the almighty power of God.


> Isaiah 55:11 - LSB
>
> <sup> 11 </sup>So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth;<br/>It will not return to Me empty,<br/>Without accomplishing what pleases Me,<br/>And without succeeding <i>in the matter </i>for which I sent it.
 

> John 3:27 - LSB
>
> <sup> 27 </sup>John answered and said, “A man can receive nothing unless it has been given him from heaven.
 

> John 17:2 - LSB
>
> <sup> 2 </sup>even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that to all whom You have given Him, He may give eternal life.
 

> Romans 9:16 - LSB
>
> <sup> 16 </sup>So then it <i>does </i>not <i>depend </i>on the one who wills or the one who runs, but on God who has mercy.
 

> 1 Corinthians 3:6-7 - LSB
>
> <sup> 6 </sup>I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth.
> <sup> 7 </sup>So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes the growth.
 

> 1 Corinthians 4:7 - LSB
>
> <sup> 7 </sup>For who regards you as superior? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?
 

> Philippians 2:12-13 - LSB
>
> <sup> 12 </sup>So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling;
> <sup> 13 </sup>for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for <i>His </i>good pleasure.
 

> James 1:18 - LSB
>
> <sup> 18 </sup>In the exercise of His will He brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of first fruits among His creatures.
 

> 1 John 5:20 - LSB
