> 1 Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying, 2 “Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.”

The Magi came from the east to Jerusalem, in their quest of this “King of the Jews”. The journey they set before themselves was a hard one — yet they persevered in their task. And where did they seek to find the King of the Jews? Where else but in Jerusalem. The Jews did not seek Christ, but these gentiles inquired to find Him. Matthew Henry wrote this, “those who truly desire to know Christ, and find Him, will not regard pains or perils in seeking after him.”




We should note the assurance of their task to find Christ. Their question was, “Where is He who has been born King of the Jews?” They did not ask, whether there were such one born, they were sure of that. What they did not know however was, *Where is He born?* Those who seek after God cannot but covet to know more of Him. I imagine they went door to door inquiring where the King was born. If asked “Why do you ask?” they might have replied “it is because we have seen His star in the east.” If asked, “What business do you, being men of the east, in seeking the King of the Jews?” Their answer was ready, “we have come to worship Him.”




Do you desire to worship Christ like these magi from the east? Is your heart filled with a desire to know more about Him, to understand Him? You would be wise to do so.
