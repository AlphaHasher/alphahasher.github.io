## Preservation of the Saints

The elect are not only redeemed by Christ and renewed by the Spirit, but also *kept* in faith by the almighty power of God. All those who are spiritually united to Christ through regeneration are eternally secure in him. Nothing can separate them from the eternal and unchangeable love of God. They have been predestined to eternal glory and are therefore assured of heaven.

## Biblical Support

The following verses show that God’s people are given eternal life the moment they believe. They are kept by God’s power through faith and nothing can separate them from His love. They have been sealed with the Holy Spirit who has been given as the guarantee of their salvation, and they are thus assured of an eternal inheritance.
