### Rome’s Position

- Roman Catholic position on authority as often described by the "three-legged stool" analogy, comprising Scripture, Tradition, and the Magisterium. Rome claims that even within this stool, there is an ontological supremacy of Scripture over Tradition and the Magisterium. This model suggests these three elements together form the rule of faith, with Rome stating they do not believe in Sola Ecclesia.

### Response

Despite this description, Rome functionally operates under Sola Ecclesia, meaning the Church (specifically the Roman Magisterium) is the ultimate authority.

- **The Magisterium Defines Extent and Meaning:** The Roman Magisterium claims the final and infallible authority to define what constitutes Scripture (its extent) and what Scripture means (its meaning). Similarly, the Magisterium defines the extent of Tradition (what is and is not Tradition) and the meaning of Tradition (what Tradition says).

- **Lack of Definable Tradition Outside Magisterial Pronouncement:** Rome does not provide a defined, accessible body of “sacred tradition” that exists independently of the Magisterium's declarations. There is “no book that tells you what is and what is not tradition” outside of what Rome has defined. [Read more here.](/posts/tradition-in-roman-catholicism)

- **Magisterium as the Gatekeeper:** The argument is made that even if one were to read early church fathers, their writings are subject to the Magisterium's interpretation. The Magisterium decides what in the writings of the early church fathers is considered “tradition” and what is not, based on whether it agrees with Rome’s current position. If a historical statement contradicts Rome’s current teaching, Rome asserts its right to interpret its own teaching, effectively overriding historical context.

- **Ontological Disconnect:** Scripture is described as Theanustos (God-breathed), giving it ultimate authority because it is God speaking. The Magisterium and Tradition are admitted by Rome to be ontologically different and not Theanustos. Placing the non-Theanustos authority (Magisterium defining Tradition and Scripture) above or in functional control of the Theanustos authority (Scripture) creates an improper relationship. This makes the three-legged stool analogy fail because two legs are of a different, inferior nature than the third.

### Conclusion

In practice, this system means that Rome’s interpretation is the final word. The authority of the church (Magisterium) interprets and defines both Scripture and Tradition, effectively making it the highest authority.
