Here is my problem before I was saved. My problem is I had sinned before God and whatever I could bring before God was tainted and shaded by my sin. So there was nothing that I could do to rid myself of this burden. How then could I be forgiven? How could God forgive me? God sent forth his son, born of a virgin, born under the law, and Christ was actively and passively obedient to God.

In His active obedience the faithful witness kept the whole law so that He was not only intrinsically righteous but He was actually righteous because of the perfection of the life that he lived. This is important because that  
righteousness can now be imputed to me.


However in his passive obedience, Christ, the spotless lamb of God, offered Himself as a vicarious substitute, receiving in Himself the penalty that I owed to God on the cross so that in His passive obedience my sinfulness could be imputed to Him.

And it is this double imputation whereby my sin is imputed to Christ, paid for on the cross, under the wrath of God, and Christ's righteousness is imputed to me so that God, as Paul says in Romans 3:25-26, could be both just because He punished sin and the “justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus” That's how Jesus freed me from my sin by his blood.



And it is our only hope. He's worthy. Amen
