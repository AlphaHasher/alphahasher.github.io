# The Unanswerable Question

Can you name one oral, extra biblical tradition, demonstratively traceable to the apostolic age, which is necessary for the faith and practice of the Church of Jesus Christ?

No verifiable example has been or can be offered. Hence, any claim that the oral component contains anything other than what is found in the written component requires the defender of such a position to prove from the writings of the early church itself that these things were generally known and believed by the Christian people. We will see that when we look at the doctrines that have been infallibly and clearly defined by Rome on the basis of “tradition” that these doctrines are, uniformly, utterly unknown in the early church.

We affirm with the Apostle Paul, ‘that according to the Way which they call a sect (or heresy, αἵρεσιν), so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and in the Prophets' (Acts 24:14).


## Breaking It Down

Roman apologists always defend this so-called tradition (the oral teachings of the Apostles).

> 2 Thessalonians 2:15 - ESV
>
> 15 - So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the **traditions** that you were taught by us, **either by our spoken word** or by our letter.

However they cannot produce any of this tradition which is demonstratively traceable to the apostolic age. [Read more here](/posts/2-Thessalonians-2.15)
